# PaScaL_TCS

Parallel and Scalable Library for Turbulent Convection Solver

The PaScal TCS is an efficient and scalable solver for large-scale direct numerical simulations of turbulent convective
flows, considering temperature-dependent fluid properties. In order to increase scalability on a massive-scale
distributed memory system, the PaScal_TCS decomposes the computational domain into a cubic-subdomain. The numerical
procedure is based on the monolithic projection method with staggered time discretization (MPM-STD), which is 
an implicit and non-iterative solver for wall-bounded turbulent flows. 
The PaScaL_TCS has the following features.

 1. Temperature-dependent fluid properties considering non-Oberbeckâ€“Boussinesq effect
 2. Three-dimensional domain decompositions to exploit more parallelism
 3. PaScaL_TDMA library to solve the batched tri-diagonal systems partitioned by the domain decomposition. 
 4. Two transpose schemes in parallel fast Fourier transform (FFT) for the pressure Poisson equation solver.
 5. An explicit intermediate aggregation scheme for MPI-IO is implemented to mitigate the IO burden with a massive number of cores.

# Directory structor
The PaScaL_TCS distribution includes the following files and directories:

```shell
LICENSE                    # the MIT License
PaScaL_TDMA                # kernel libraries for PaScaL_TCS
run                        # simple test problem
src                        # source files
Makefile                   # make build file
Makefile.inc               # compile options
README                     # this file
```

# Build
The commands below perform a default PaScaL_TCS build, 
```shell
make                       # build a PaScaL_TCS executable 
```
The ```make``` above contains building PaScaL_TDMA using ```PaScaL_TDMA/make```, and builds PaScaL_TCS execution file using ```src/make``` with automately linking PaScaL_TDMA. It creates the PaScaL_TCS execution file ```PaScaL_TCS.ex ``` in the directory ```run```.

# Example test
The example of the ```run``` directory is executed with the input file ```PARA_INPUT.dat```.
```shell
mpirun -np 8 ./PaScaL_TCS.ex 
```

The example ```PARA_INPUT.dat``` file contains the information for NOB natural convection simulation of $\Delta=10$ with $Pr=1$ at $Ra=100$ in $512\times128\times256$ meshes using 8 MPI processes. It will make ```run/data/1_continue/``` and binary outputs as follows:
```shell
cont_time.bin               # Current dimensionless time for file write and dt
cont_U.bin                  # Velocity field in x-direction for file write
cont_V.bin                  # Velocity field in y-direction for file write
cont_W.bin                  # Velocity field in z-direction for file write
cont_P.bin                  # Pressure field for file write
cont_THETA.bin              # Temperature field for file write
```
